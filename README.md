# Custom Dashboard Project

Hi, I'm Sabareesh. I have created an updated version of the dashboard as specified in the task. This project replicates the functionality and design of the [Vue Material Dashboard](https://demos.creative-tim.com/vue-material-dashboard/?_ga=2.76874963.776133716.1716400679-1408695073.1716400679#/user) using modern technologies.

## Overview

The project is built with the following technologies:
- **Vite**: For fast and optimized builds.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components with utility-first CSS.

## Live Demo

You can check out the live version of the dashboard using the following links:
